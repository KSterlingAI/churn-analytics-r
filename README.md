# Customer Churn Analysis in R

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using a public Telco dataset.
The goal is to predict whether a customer will cancel the service using logistic regression.

## Dataset
Telco Customer Churn Dataset (7,043 customers, 21 variables)

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Train/Test split (70/30)
- Logistic Regression model
- Model evaluation using Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC

## Results
- Accuracy: 81%
- AUC: 0.855
- Strong discriminative performance.

## Key Business Insights
- Higher churn observed among month-to-month contracts
- Customers with shorter tenure cancel more
- Higher monthly charges are associated with higher churn

## Tools Used
- R
- tidyverse
- caret
- pROC
